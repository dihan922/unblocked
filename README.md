# Unblocked

A website to aid dancers with choreo block and freestyle dancing

## Acknowledgements
The website concept and outreach with testers was contributed by Jayden Pagsolingan.

## Future Plans
Since the current website uses pure JavaScript, I plan to overhaul the site using the MERN stack. This overhaul will allow for better data management and open the door for integrating an AI API.
